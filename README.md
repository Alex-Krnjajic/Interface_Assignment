app devolopment: 
I spent several hours trying to implement subitems until I realised it wasn't worth it

rest of the app was pretty straightforward, i put the names,info and icons of the entries into arrays so that when you press an item it will grab whatever is in the corresponding array index. Most of my headaches came from trying to understand the ArrayAdapter. I maybe should have used the simple adapter, but it does work right now so...  
Oh and I also had fun messing with the layout xml when I didn't know what styles was, good times.
